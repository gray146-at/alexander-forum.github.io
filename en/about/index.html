      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="tag">The Alexander Forum for Reflection & Resilience</p>

      <p class="lead">
        The <strong>Alexander Forum for Reflection & Resilience</strong> was founded in October 2025 by Dorian Rammer in Vienna. We are an independent, non-profit think tank that understands societal crises and personal pressures as interconnected phenomena.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We live in a time of multiple overloads: climate crisis, geopolitical tensions, digital disorientation, social fragmentation. At the same time, psychological pressures, loneliness, and exhaustion are increasing. These two levels – the societal and the personal – are intertwined: Those under pressure can contribute less to the community. Unresolved societal tensions weaken each individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        We therefore understand resilience not as individual "holding on," but as a shared design task. It's about creating conditions under which people and communities not only survive but can thrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Working Method</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional think tanks, we do not primarily focus on events, panels and conferences, but on intellectual depth, written precision and interdisciplinary synthesis.
      </p>
      <p><strong>We publish:</strong></p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Essays</strong> – reflective, in-depth analyses on societal questions (5,000–15,000 words)</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Briefs</strong> – practice-oriented statements with concrete recommendations (3,000–5,000 words)</li>
        <li><strong>Foundation Dossiers</strong> – comprehensive explorations of fundamental topics (20,000+ words)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our work is interdisciplinary: We connect psychology, political science, sociology, medicine, history and philosophy. We name uncertainties transparently, work with sources and search for perspectives that are lost in daily debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We promote reflection over stimulus overload and a dialogue that tolerates contradictions and takes different perspectives seriously.
      </p>

      <h2>Team</h2>
      
      <h3>Dorian Rammer – Founder & Director</h3>
      <p>
        Born 1996, lives in Vienna. Background in politics, emergency medical services, hospitality and marketing. Author, essayist and public speaker on topics of mental health and societal crisis phenomena (including ORF topic 2025 on chemsex, reach >500k).
      </p>
      <p>
        Dorian works at the intersection of politics, psychosocial practice and societal analysis. His perspective combines personal crisis experience – trauma, addiction, violence, financial crises, suicide attempt – with empirical evidence. These experiences do not serve as illustration, but as analytical access to systemic dynamics: How does resilience emerge? What do people need to cope with crises? Where do systems fail, and how can they improve?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Focus areas:</strong> Resilience research, crisis communication, trauma, addiction, identity, political civil courage, societal cohesion.

      <h2>Advisory Board</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Under construction.</em> We are looking for experts from the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Psychology & Psychotherapy</li>
        <li>Political Science & International Relations</li>
        <li>Sociology & Social Work</li>
        <li>Medicine & Public Health</li>
        <li>Philosophy & Ethics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The advisory board advises us on thematic orientation, provides feedback on publications and expands the network. Time commitment: 2–3 meetings per year, no payment, but visibility on the website and involvement in program development.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>Research Team & Network</h2>
      <p>
        The Alexander Forum works interdisciplinarily and network-based. Contributions flow in from psychology, political science, data analysis, medicine, communication – as well as from peer experts with crisis experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our network includes affected individuals, practitioners from the field and political actors. This exchange connects scientific, social and practical dimensions into a shared discourse space.
      </p>

      <h2>Guest Authors & Collaborations</h2>
      <p>
        We see ourselves as a platform for different perspectives. We welcome guest contributions from experts, practitioners and affected individuals.
