      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="tag">The Alexander Forum for Reflection & Resilience</p>

      <p class="lead">
        The <strong>Alexander Forum for Reflection & Resilience</strong> was founded in 2025 by Dorian Rammer in Vienna. We are an independent, non-profit Think & Do Tank that understands societal crises and personal burdens as interconnected phenomena.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We live in a time of multiple overloads: climate crisis, geopolitical tensions, digital disorientation, social fragmentation. At the same time, psychological stress, loneliness, and exhaustion are increasing. These two levels – the societal and the personal – are intertwined: Those under pressure can contribute less to the community. Unresolved societal tensions weaken each individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        We therefore understand resilience not as individual "endurance," but as a shared design task. It's about creating conditions under which people and communities don't just survive, but can thrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Working Method</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on intellectual depth, written precision, and interdisciplinary synthesis. Our work connects psychology, political science, sociology, medicine, history, and philosophy. We transparently acknowledge uncertainties, work with sources, and seek perspectives that get lost in daily debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We promote <strong>reflection over information overload</strong> and dialogue that tolerates contradictions and takes different perspectives seriously. The Forum invites discourse and seeks ways in which constructive thinking can become collective action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work remains practice-oriented: in essays and analyses, in <strong>briefings</strong> for organizations, and in <strong>workshops</strong> that enable exchange and strengthen resilience as a shared attitude.
      </p>

      <h2>Team</h2>
      
      <h3>Dorian Rammer – Founder & Director</h3>
      <p>
        Born 1996, lives in Vienna. Background in politics, emergency medical services, and communication. Author, essayist, and speaker on mental health and societal crisis phenomena (including ORF-Thema 2025 on chemsex, reach >500k).
      </p>
      <p>
        Dorian works at the intersection of politics, psychosocial practice, and societal analysis. His perspective combines personal crisis experience with empirical evidence – not as illustration, but as analytical access to systemic dynamics: How does resilience emerge? What do people need to overcome crises? Where do systems fail, and how can they improve?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Focus areas:</strong> Interpersonal interaction, trauma, addiction, identity, political civic courage, social cohesion.
      </p>

      <h2>Advisory Board</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Under development.</em> We are seeking experts from psychology, political science, sociology, medicine, philosophy, and related fields. The advisory board advises on thematic direction, provides feedback on publications, and expands the network. Time commitment: 2–3 meetings per year, no payment, but visibility on the website and involvement in program development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interested?</strong> Write to: <a href="mailto:kontakt@alexanderforum.org">kontakt@alexanderforum.org</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Research Team & Network</h2>
      <p>
        The Alexander Forum works interdisciplinarily and network-based. Contributions flow in from various disciplines as well as from peer experts with crisis experience. Our network includes those affected, practitioners, and political actors. This exchange connects scientific, social, and practical dimensions into a shared discourse space.
      </p>

      <h2>Guest Contributions & Collaborations</h2>
      <p>
        We see ourselves as a platform for diverse perspectives and welcome guest contributions from experts, practitioners, and those with lived experience.
